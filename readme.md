# Fun Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects I've built to explore the language's capabilities and improve my coding skills. While they may seem simple on the surface, each project helps me to understand better Python concepts and problem-solving techniques.

Currently, the repository includes:

* Mad Libs Game: This interactive game prompts users for words, then uses them to construct a silly story.
* Guess the Number: A classic game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a set number of attempts.
These projects are just the beginning!
